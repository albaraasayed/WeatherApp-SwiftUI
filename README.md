# WeatherCast

WeatherCast is a beautifully designed, immersive weather app built completely in SwiftUI. Providing accurate, up-to-date weather forecasts, it leverages stunning glassmorphic UI elements and dynamic backgrounds to bring the forecast to life directly on your device.

## UI/UX & Design Concept
WeatherCast is crafted with a focus on premium visual excellence. The user experience is built around a modern glassmorphic design system, dynamic gradients, and gorgeous custom 3D weather icons that dynamically adapt based on the time of day and conditions.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Weather:** Accurate current conditions, temperature, high/low, and feels-like data.
- **Detailed Forecasts:** Navigate seamlessly through hourly and 7-day weekly forecasts in an intuitive bottom sheet layout.
- **Comprehensive Data Widgets:** In-depth weather metrics including Air Quality Index (AQI), Sunrise/Sunset, UV Index, Wind Speed & Direction, Rainfall, Humidity, Visibility, and Atmospheric Pressure.
- **Current Location Support:** Automatic, on-demand weather fetching for your device's current location via GPS.
- **Location Management:** Search for cities globally (optimized with request debouncing) and save your favorites.
- **Dynamic Theming:** Background visuals and typography intelligently adapt depending on whether it is day or night in the selected city.

## Tech Stack & Tools
- **Language:** Swift 5.9+
- **UI Toolkit:** SwiftUI
- **State Management:** Observation Framework (`@Observable`)
- **Local Persistence:** SwiftData
- **Location Services:** CoreLocation
- **Networking:** Native `URLSession` with `async/await` concurrency
- **External API:** [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com)

## Architecture & Design Patterns
WeatherCast follows a clean **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern to ensure scalability and maintainability:
- **Models:** Codable structs defining the data structure matching the WeatherAPI JSON responses, alongside `@Model` classes for local persistence.
- **ViewModels:** Encapsulate business logic, network requests, and manage application state using the modern `@Observable` macro.
- **Views:** Declarative, modular SwiftUI views that automatically react to state changes in the ViewModels.
- **Data Persistence:** User's saved locations are persisted locally using Apple's modern **SwiftData** framework, ensuring seamless data retrieval and offline capability for favorite cities.

## Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/albaraasayed/WeatherApp-SwiftUI.git
   ```
2. **Open the project:**
   Open the `WeatherCast App.xcodeproj` file in **Xcode 15** or later.
3. **Configure the API Key:**
   - Sign up for a free API key at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com).
   - Locate the API configuration file (e.g., `Constants.swift` inside the `Utils` folder).
   - Insert your API key into the designated variable: `let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`
4. **Build and Run:**
   Select your preferred iOS Simulator or physical device and hit `Cmd + R` to run the application.
